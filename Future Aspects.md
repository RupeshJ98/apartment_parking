**Future Aspects for this Project:**
  -Integration with IoT-Based Slot Detection
    Incorporate low-cost IoT sensors (e.g., ultrasonic or magnetic) in each parking slot to automatically detect real-time occupancy and sync with the app for hands-free updates.

  -Smart Slot Status Recognition
    Enable hardware-based detection to eliminate manual booking. Slot status (available/occupied) is auto-updated based on sensor data, improving accuracy and reducing user effort.

  -Designed for Mid-Scale Residential Complexes
    Tailored for housing societies or mid-sized apartment buildings where finding a free parking spot is often frustrating due to lack of visibility.

  -User-Based Notifications & Alerts
    Push notifications to remind users when their booked time is about to expire, or when their reserved slot is occupied by someone else.

  -Admin Dashboard for Parking Management Committees
    Provide an administrative view to allow committee members to monitor usage, override bookings, assign reserved spots, or view analytics.

  -Auto-Release of Booked Slots
    Implement logic to automatically release spots once the allocated time expires (unless marked as overnight).

  -QR Code Scanning for On-Spot Booking
    Users can scan a QR code at each slot to instantly book or check availability via the app.

  -Vehicle Number Integration for Security
    Associate bookings with vehicle numbers to help security staff verify parked vehicles and prevent unauthorized usage.

  -Dynamic Slot Allocation for Guests or Visitors
    Allow temporary guest bookings with time-limited access, managed through an invite or approval system.

  -Cloud Sync and Multi-Device Support
    Sync user accounts and booking history across devices through cloud-based login and real-time data sharing.
